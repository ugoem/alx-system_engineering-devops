# 0x0D Web stack debugging #0 :wrench:

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

* Network basics
* Docker
* Resources

## man or help:
``` curl ```
# Requirements
## General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All your Bash script files must be executable
* Your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error
* Your Bash scripts must run without error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

> Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually. This project covers the optimal framework and blueprint for debugging web stack (remote containers this scenario) bugs

Challenge:

Get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it. After connecting to the container and fixing whatever needed to be fixed (here is your mission), you can see that curling port 80 return a page that contains Hello Holberton. Paste the command(s) you used to fix the issue in your answer file.
Here we can see that after starting my Docker container, I curl the port 8080 mapped to the Docker container port 80, it does not return a page but an error message. Note that you might also get the error message curl: (52) Empty reply from server.


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state.


## Results :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### Resources

- emacs
- BASH
- Debian 9 stable / Ubuntu 16.04 / Ubuntu 18.04 
- Shellcheck
- Puppet 3.8
- Puppet-lint 2.1.1
- Docker

### Try It On Your Machine :computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sammykingx/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
cd 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0
cat FILENAME
docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it CONTAINER_ID
curl 0:8080
MUST SHOW REPLY FROM SERVER

```
-->

```bash
# i realized that installing apache2 on my machine doesn't automatically starts
# apache as in the case of nginx. as such i neede to start the apache web server
# which actually gave me the expected results as apache is configured to listen
# to port 80 by default.


$ service apache2 start

$ curl localhost

```
